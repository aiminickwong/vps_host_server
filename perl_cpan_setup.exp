# 1) timing - A surprising number of programs (rn, ksh, zsh, telnet, etc.) and devices discard or ignore keystrokes that arrive "too
# quickly" after prompts.  If you find your new script hanging up at one spot, try adding a short sleep just before the previous send.
# Setting "force_conservative" to 1 (see below) makes Expect do this automatically - pausing briefly before sending each character.  This
# pacifies every program I know of.  The -c flag makes the script do this in the first place.  The -C flag allows you to define a
# character to toggle this mode off and on.
set force_conservative 0  ;# set to 1 to force conservative mode even if script wasn't run conservatively originally
if {$force_conservative} {
	set send_slow {1 .1}
	proc send {ignore arg} {
		sleep .1
		exp_send -s -- $arg
	}
}
# 2) differing output - Some programs produce different output each time they run.  The "date" command is an obvious example.  Another is
# ftp, if it produces throughput statistics at the end of a file transfer.  If this causes a problem, delete these patterns or replace
# them with wildcards.  An alternative is to use the -p flag (for "prompt") which makes Expect only look for the last line of output
# (i.e., the prompt).  The -P flag allows you to define a character to toggle this mode off and on.
